# Little-Space-Game
A little game in Xlib :) 
# Want to run it?
Unfortunately it's not super portable.This will probably only run on a UNIX machine. 
If you are on a mac computer, please download XQuartz. Then you compile the program by writing "make" in the terminal in the right directory. Run it by hitting the executable "./pop". 
I have tried to make this work on Ubuntu but I ran into some problems. For sure though, this runs on any Mac with XQuartz installed.
Download XQuartz here: http://www.xquartz.org/

# Gameplay

One can play with keys on the keyboard or click with the mouse.
